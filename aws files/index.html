    <h2>What is AWS?</h2>
    <p>
      In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure
      services to businesses in the form of web services -- now commonly known
      as cloud computing. One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the
      opportunity to replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low
      variable costs that scale with your business. With the Cloud, businesses
      no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure
      weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds
      or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster. Today,
      Amazon Web Services provides a highly reliable, scalable, low-cost
      infrastructure platform in the cloud that powers hundreds of thousands of
      businesses in 190 countries around the world. With data center locations
      in the U.S., Europe, Brazil, Singapore, Japan, and Australia, customers
      across all industries are taking advantage of the following benefits:
