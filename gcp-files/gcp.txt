GCP - Google Cloud Platform 
-- What it is and why you should use it and how

-First, what is a Cloud Platform?
A cloud platform lets you leverage its resources to empower the applications you build, as well as to reach a broader base of customers.
Cloud computing today allows hardware and software products to co-exist remotely (in data centers) and at-scale. 
Together these products work to deliver specific services. Users typically can access, manage, and use the tools they require via a web-interface – and that’s true for Google Cloud Platform services as well.
GCP is essentially a public cloud-based machine whose services are delivered to customers on an as-you-go basis, by way of service components.
The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a platform that delivers over 90 information technology services (aka products),
which businesses, IT professionals, and developers can leverage to work more efficiently, gain more flexibility, and/or enable a strategic advantage.
In addition to service accessibility, users also gain flexibility and choice when working with Google Cloud Platform: 
Each service is available ‘a la carte’ so that users can leverage different resources to develop the infrastructure they need.
Once they have identified the Google Cloud Platform services that would benefit them, users simply create a “project” via the intuitive, web-based GCP Console. Better still, project owners can manage which team members or admins have access to which services.


-- WHAT DOES GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM DO 

-Google Cloud Platform is a provider of computing resources for deploying and operating applications on the web. 
Its specialty is providing a place for individuals and enterprises to build and run software, and it uses the web to connect to the users of that software. 
Think of tens of thousands of websites operating on a network of "hyperscale" (very big, but also very divisible) data centers, and you'll get the basic idea.
When you run a website, an application, or a service on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Google keeps track of all of the resources it uses -- specifically, how much processing power, data storage, database queries, and network connectivity it consumes. 
Rather than lease a server or a DNS address by the month (which is what you would do with an ordinary website provider), you pay for each of these resources on a per-second basis (competitors charge per-minute), with discounts that apply when your services are used heavily by your customers on the web.

-- DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM

-So what do you actually do on a cloud platform, and why would you want to do it on Google's? 
You use a cloud platform when you want the services you present to your users, your customers, or your fellow employees to be an application as opposed to a website. 
Maybe you want to help homebuilders estimate the size and structure of the cabinets they need to rebuild a kitchen. Maybe you're analyzing the performance statistics of athletes trying out for a college sports club, and you need sophisticated analytics to tell the head coaches whose performance could improve. 
Or you could be scanning hundreds of thousands of pages of archived newspaper copy, and you need to build a scannable index dating back decades.

You use a cloud platform such as GCP when you want to build and run an application that can leverage the power of hyperscale data centers in some way: 
to reach users worldwide, or to borrow sophisticated analytics and AI functions, or to utilize massive data storage, or to take advantage of cost efficiencies. 
You pay not for the machine but for the resources the machine uses.

--Google Cloud Platform is perceived to have certain competitive strengths:

-Automating the deployment of modern applications. 
An app is made of many moving parts, which is why some developers prefer to build their apps in the cloud to begin with ("cloud-native"). 
Google is the originator of Kubernetes, which is an orchestrator for applications comprised of many components. Early on, Google took a proactive approach to automating the deployment of these multifaceted apps to the cloud: 
for example, opening itself to Kubo, an automation platform originally created to help developers using Cloud Foundry to deploy their applications from dev platforms to the cloud.

-Creative cost control. 
As you'll see later, rather than being the low-cost leader, Google's strategy with GCP is to enable cost competitiveness in certain "sweet spot" scenarios. 
For example, Google offers a lifecycle manager for its object data storage, which enables the offloading or deletion of objects that haven't been used in 30 days or more.

-Friendlier hand-holding for first-time users. 
A cloud services platform can be an overwhelming concept for a newcomer to digest. Just as it wasn't obvious to many consumers what the purpose of a microcomputer actually was, a public cloud is a new and foreign beast for folks who are accustomed to seeing and touching the machine they're using.  
GCP offers step-by-step examples of doing many of the most common tasks -- for example, spinning up a Linux-based virtual machine, which is like claiming and setting up your own, brand new computer out of thin air.
