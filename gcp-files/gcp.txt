GCP - Google Cloud Platform 
What it is and why you should use it and how

First, what is a Cloud Platform
A public cloud lets you leverage its resources to empower the applications you build, as well as to reach a broader base of customers.
Cloud computing today allows hardware and software products to co-exist remotely (in data centers) and at-scale. 
Together these products work to deliver specific services. Users typically can access, manage, and use the tools they require via a web-interface – and that’s true for Google Cloud Platform services as well.
GCP is essentially a public cloud-based machine whose services are delivered to customers on an as-you-go basis, by way of service components.
The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a platform that delivers over 90 information technology services (aka products),
which businesses, IT professionals, and developers can leverage to work more efficiently, gain more flexibility, and/or enable a strategic advantage.
In addition to service accessibility, users also gain flexibility and choice when working with Google Cloud Platform: 
Each service is available ‘a la carte’ so that users can leverage different resources to develop the infrastructure they need.
Once they have identified the Google Cloud Platform services that would benefit them, users simply create a “project” via the intuitive, web-based GCP Console. Better still, project owners can manage which team members or admins have access to which services.
